Welcome to the mexican train table sim! 
This app is designed to be used as a remote way to play mexican train with your friends. 
The main idea is that this app is intended to be a table simulator with domino objects to be used to show all players what the table looks like simultaneously.
Each player will be able to see the table as well as his/her own hand of dominoes. 
Upon beginning this endeavor, the inspiration was to allow a way for my parents who play every week with their neighbors in person at each other's houses. 
My parents needed to move, however and wanted a way to continue playing with them.
This application seeks to solve that particular problem by allowing full freedom of the table as though the players are there.
This means the players can freely interact with the dominoes and keep score themselves.
Because of this, the functioning of the app will tend to be less restrictive as far as what players are allowed to do.
House rules will be easy to use as the app will not impose restrictions with few exceptions.
